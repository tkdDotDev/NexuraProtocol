# Advanced Feature: Multi-Signature Payment Release

## Overview

Nexura Protocol implements a multi-signature verification system requiring 2-of-3 approvals before funds are released from escrow.

## How It Works

1. Buyer creates invoice and locks funds
2. Delivery occurs
3. Three authorized verifiers vote on delivery confirmation
4. When 2 out of 3 approve, payment releases automatically
